Foundations of Python Programming
=================================

Programming is not a "spectator sport".  It is something you do,
something you participate in. It would make sense, then,
that the book you use to learn programming should allow you to be active.
That is our goal.

This book is meant to provide you with an interactive experience as you learn
to program in Python.  You can read the text, watch videos,
and write and execute Python code.  In addition to simply executing code,
there is a unique feature called 'codelens' that allows you to control the
flow of execution in order to gain a better understanding of how the program
works.

Getting Started
===============

We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to build and use this book.  

1.  You can build it and host it yourself in just a few simple steps:

    1.  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``  -- Should install everything you need
    2.  ``runestone build`` -- will build the html and put it in ``./build/fopp``
    3.  ``runestone serve``   -- will start a webserver and serve the pages locally from ``./build/fopp``


Helping
=======

If you want to do bug fixes and are looking for the version of this book that is deployed on Runestone.Academy, you can find that code by changing to the ``ac101`` branch after you have cloned this repository.

We welcome PR to fix typos, unclear wording, incorrect results, or anything else that needs fixing.  The book has been used by many many people, so if you think that an answer is incorrect, please make sure you double check your work before submitting an issue or making a PR.
